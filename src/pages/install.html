    <h1>Regex Search 1.6</h1>
    <b>How to use:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Type in a regex query and click Next to search. Clicking Next again will go to the next match. Modifying the search query will clear the current search. Note that this extension will not work on the Chrome store, so do not test it on any Chrome store pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Notes:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>You can open the extension by typing Alt+Shift+F. You can go to the next and previous search results by typing Alt+Shift+N and Alt+Shift+P, respectively. These shortcuts can be configured by going to the bottom of the extensions page and clicking "Keyboard Shortcuts"</li>
        <li>This extension uses the JavaScript regex engine. I create a regular expression using 'new RegExp(regexp, flags)', where flags are currently either 'g' or 'gi'.</li>
        <li>This extension is open source and the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/gsingh93/regex-search">here</a>. I'd appreciate any help, whether it's adding new features, fixing bugs, or making the extension look better (including this page).</li>
